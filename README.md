## Getting started

`nexume` can be installed by running the following `npx` command.

```
npx create-nexume-app
```

> This will generate a folder containing basic `nexume` template.

-----

## Before installing

Make sure `node.js` version over 18 is installed on your machine.

```bash
node -v
```

> if node version is below 18, you can run one of the following commands to upgrade or change node version.

`Homebrew`

```bash
# Install node version using homebrew.
brew install node@18

# Unlink previously used node version.
brew unlink node

# Link newly installed node version.
brew link node@18
```

`nvm`

```bash
# Install node version using nvm.
nvm install v18.12.0

# Choose newly installed node version.
nvm use v18.12.0
```

`sudo`

```bash
# Install node version using sudo.
sudo n 18.12.0

# Choose newly installed node version on drop-down menu.
sudo n

## Deploying your app

Most hosting platforms allow you to define `build` command and `output` folder:

- Build command: `npm run build` or `next build`
- Output folder: `out`

> Make sure your hosting platform options are the same as above.

## Folder structure

`nexume` requires a precise folder structure:

- `public`: Contains all publicly accessible images (`favicon.ico`, `profile_img.png`)
- `app`: Contains all tsx files (`page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`)
- `out`: Contains all static assets (`html`, `js`, `css`)

> See complete documentation at [Next.js project structure](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/project-structure).

### `public`

Next.js serve static assets inside a folder called `public` in the root directory. 

Files inside `public` can be referenced starting from the base url(/).

For example, if you want to reference `/public/profile_img.png` in your code, 

you can do so by writing `/profile_img.png` as path.

### `app`

Next.js introduced `app router` in version 13, which argues to offer improved route handling.

It will be unnecessary to get into details of `app routing` in this doc, since `nexume` only offers single page resume template.

> You can explore more about `app routing` at [App Router | Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#advanced-routing-patterns)

### `out`

Next.js allow you to export static files by breaking a strict SPA into individual HTML files.

This allows you to deploy this project on any hosting platform that serve static HTML/CSS/JS files.

Broken down static assets are all stored inside `out` folder in the root directory.

## Config options

Some configurable options are stored inside `nexume.config.ts` in the root directory.

This config file is made to offer easier customization of some configurable options.
