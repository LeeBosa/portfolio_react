`nexume` is a static resume template using [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) and [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss).

## Getting started

`nexume` can be installed by running the following `npx` command.

```
npx create-nexume-app
```

This will generate a build folder containing basic `nexume` template.

Make sure `node.js` version over 18 is installed on your machine.

```bash
node -v
```

if node version is below 18, you can run one of the following commands to upgrade or change node version.

`Homebrew`

```bash
# Install node version using homebrew.
brew install node@18

# Unlink previously used node version.
brew unlink node

# Link newly installed node version.

```

`nvm`

```bash
# Install node version using nvm.
nvm install v18.12.0

# Choose newly installed node version.
nvm use v18.12.0
```
